    <p>Hello, my name is Paulina and I am currently a senior at Point Park University.
      I am looking to graduate in the fall. Some of my interests include, playing games like,
      Rummy 500 or playing on my Nintendo Switch. I enjoy being outside and like to show my kids
      the different kind of mosses and flowers we can find outside. I also like learning about
      cool science facts, like how big Betelgeuse is compared to our sun.</p>

    <p>In the fall ill be taking 5 courses, Principles of Management, Microcomputing I,
      Web Application Development, Digital Security, and Principles of Econ/Microeconomics.
      In which completes my bachelorâ€™s in science and I could not be happier.</p>

    <p>You can get in touch with me personally through my school email, pshutt@pointpark.edu.
      Thank you!</p>
